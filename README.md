# THEORY:-

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that analyzes and models data without labelled responses or predefined categories. Unlike supervised learning, where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs, unsupervised learning algorithms work solely with input data and aim to discover hidden patterns, structures or relationships within the dataset independently, without any human intervention or prior knowledge of the data's meaning.

CLUSTERING: Clustering is a data mining technique which groups unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. Clustering algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups represented by structures or patterns in the information. Clustering algorithms can be categorized into a few types, specifically exclusive, overlapping, hierarchical, and probabilistic. There are a great many clustering algorithms. They differ primarily in how they measure "similarity" or "proximity" and in what kinds of features they work with. 

K-MEANS CLUSTERING: K-means clustering measures similarity using ordinary straight-line distance (Euclidean distance, in other words). It creates clusters by placing a number of points, called centroids, inside the feature-space. Each point in the dataset is assigned to the cluster of whichever centroid it's closest to. The "k" in "k-means" is how many centroids (that is, clusters) it creates. K-means, is intuitive and easy to apply in a feature engineering context. Depending on your application another algorithm might be more appropriate.


# Problem Statement:-

In today’s highly competitive business environment, companies interact with a diverse customer base that varies in preferences, purchasing behaviors, and spending capacity. Treating all customers the same often leads to ineffective marketing strategies, poor resource allocation, and reduced customer satisfaction.
To overcome this challenge, businesses need to understand and categorize their customers into distinct groups based on behavioral and demographic similarities. However, manually identifying such patterns in large customer datasets is impractical and prone to bias.
This project aims to develop an unsupervised machine learning model using K-Means Clustering to automatically segment customers into meaningful groups based on key attributes such as annual income, spending score, and other behavioral metrics. The goal is to enable data-driven marketing strategies and enhance customer relationship management.

# Objectives:-

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

1) Import and explore the customer dataset.
  
2) Handle missing values, outliers, and normalize numerical features for better clustering performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1) Visualize relationships between customer attributes (e.g., income vs. spending score).
   
2) Identify underlying patterns and data distribution using statistical and graphical methods.

Model Development using K-Means Clustering:

1) Apply the K-Means algorithm to group customers based on selected features.

2) Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

Cluster Interpretation and Profiling:

1) Analyze each cluster’s characteristics (e.g., high-income–high-spending, low-income–low-spending).

2) Assign descriptive labels to each cluster for marketing interpretation.

Visualization and Insights:

1) Present clustering results through visualizations (2D/3D plots, heatmaps).

2)  Derive actionable insights to help businesses tailor marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and customer engagement strategies.

Conclusion and Future Scope:

1) Summarize findings and discuss how segmentation improves marketing efficiency.

2) Suggest extensions such as using hierarchical or DBSCAN clustering for comparison or incorporating more features (e.g., age, gender, purchase frequency).
