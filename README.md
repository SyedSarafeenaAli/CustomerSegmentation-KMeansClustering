UNSUPERVISED LEARNING: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that analyzes and models data without labelled responses or predefined categories. Unlike supervised learning, where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs, unsupervised learning algorithms work solely with input data and aim to discover hidden patterns, structures or relationships within the dataset independently, without any human intervention or prior knowledge of the data's meaning.

CLUSTERING: Clustering is a data mining technique which groups unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. Clustering algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups represented by structures or patterns in the information. Clustering algorithms can be categorized into a few types, specifically exclusive, overlapping, hierarchical, and probabilistic. There are a great many clustering algorithms. They differ primarily in how they measure "similarity" or "proximity" and in what kinds of features they work with. 

K-MEANS CLUSTERING: K-means clustering measures similarity using ordinary straight-line distance (Euclidean distance, in other words). It creates clusters by placing a number of points, called centroids, inside the feature-space. Each point in the dataset is assigned to the cluster of whichever centroid it's closest to. The "k" in "k-means" is how many centroids (that is, clusters) it creates. K-means, is intuitive and easy to apply in a feature engineering context. Depending on your application another algorithm might be more appropriate.
